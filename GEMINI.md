# Project Overview

This is a React-based web application called "CeylonQuest". Based on the file structure and component names, it appears to be a website for a travel or tourism company focused on Sri Lanka. The application is built with Vite and uses React Router for navigation. Styling is done with Tailwind CSS.

    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Lint the code:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

5.  **Preview the production build:**

    ```

6.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**

## Development Conventions

*   The project uses functional components with hooks.
*   Styling is primarily done using Tailwind CSS, as indicated by the `tailwind.config.js` file and `className` attributes in the components.
*   The project is structured with a `src` directory containing `components`, `pages`, `assets`, and `data` folders.
*   Routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.
*   The project uses ESLint for code linting.
